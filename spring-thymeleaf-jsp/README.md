# spring-thymeleaf-jsp - helping JSP and Thymeleaf play together

The spring-thymeleaf-jsp library is intended to help anyone wanting
to make the jump from JSP's to Thymeleaf templates for their view technology.

It does this by:
 * providing an easy configuration for spring applications to serve both
   JSP and thymeleaf views without having to worry about namespacing them
   or configuring view resolvers.
